# Extracting a 2D Silhouette (Deprecated)

This document outlines the process for dynamically generating a 2D silhouette polygon from a 3D model. This technique is highly effective for creating accurate 2D physics colliders for 3D objects, especially in a top-down perspective, as it accounts for the model's current shape (e.g., from an animation).

## The Process

The workflow involves rendering the object's shape to a texture and then using image processing algorithms to convert that 2D image into a 2D physics-ready polygon.

### 1. Optimize Model (Optional)

To improve the performance of the render-to-texture step, it's beneficial to use a lower-polygon version of your model. This step can often be skipped if the source model is already reasonably low-poly.

### 2. Setup Top-Down Orthographic Camera

Position an **orthographic camera** directly above the model, looking straight down. This camera will be used to capture the 2D "shadow" or outline of the object on the X/Z plane.

### 3. Render-to-Texture

Render the 3D object (using its dynamic, possibly animated, shape) into a separate, low-resolution off-screen buffer, also known as a render target.

This render must use a simple, unlit shader that renders the object as **pure white** against a **pure black** background. The resulting texture is a binary (black and white) 2D representation of the model's silhouette.

### 4. Read Pixels

Read the pixel data from the render target texture back to the CPU. This gives you a 2D grid of binary data (1s for white, 0s for black) that represents the object's shape.

### 5. Trace Outline

Process this 2D pixel grid using an outline-tracing algorithm like **Marching Squares**. This algorithm "walks" the boundary between the white (object) and black (empty) pixels, generating a 2D polygon (a list of 2D vertices) that describes the outline of the "blob."

### 6. Simplify Polygon (Optional)

The polygon generated by Marching Squares will be very detailed and "jagged," as it follows the pixel edges perfectly. This high vertex count can be inefficient for a physics engine.

If needed, use a polygon simplification algorithm (such as **Ramer-Douglas-Peucker**) to reduce the vertex count significantly while preserving the overall shape. This step may not be necessary if the render-to-texture resolution is very low, as the resulting polygon will already be quite simple.

### 7. Decompose Polygon (If Needed)

Most 2D physics engines require collision shapes to be **convex** (i.e., no "dents" or "caves"). If the silhouette shape is concave (e.g., a "U" shape), it must be broken down into a set of smaller, convex polygons. This is achieved by running the polygon's vertices through a **2D convex decomposition** algorithm.

### 8. Normalize Coordinates

The final step is to convert the polygon's vertices from their pixel coordinates (e.g., 0-256) back into the 2D world-space or local-space coordinates that the physics engine understands (e.g., mapping the pixel positions back to the model's X and Z coordinates).

## Final Output

The result of this process is a set of one or more 2D convex polygons that accurately represent the top-down silhouette of the 3D model, ready to be used by a 2D physics engine.
